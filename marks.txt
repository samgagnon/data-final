General comments
----------------------------------------

Generally a nice exposition of the relevant concepts.
A solid project overall, executed fairly well.

I'm not sure the normalization step for the maps was necessary.
It would've been easier to simply rescale the C_l.

The figures didn't have units! But I very much appreciated Figure 6!
It was a very nice way to visualize how things were different in
different parts of the sky.

While overall the code could've used a little bit more
commenting and documentation, PartitionCode.py was a standout
in this respect and was very nicely done.

It was a pleasure having the three of you in the class!
And to Sam and Louis---congratulations on finishing
up your degrees! I hope all of you have a restful
and enjoyable summer!

Best,
Adrian
